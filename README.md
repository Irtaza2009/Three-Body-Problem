# The Three-Body Problem

A simulation of three celestial bodies interacting through gravitational forces. The system exhibits chaotic behaviour where small changes can lead to dramatically different outcomes.

With cool **sound effects** for the gravity and collisions!

And interactive controls and parameters!
